## To master time, master your ‘internal triggers.’
“All human behavior is driven by a desire to escape discomfort. That means that time management is pain management,” he says. “We need to understand the uncomfortable sensations we're trying to escape when we reach for our cell phones or email accounts, then learn new techniques for managing that discomfort in a healthier manner.” 
Next time you get the urge to pick up your phone and mindlessly scroll through Facebook, recognize the trigger and do something else instead. Make a phone call you’ve been putting off all week or pick up a book and read a chapter instead.

### Remove the external triggers that don't serve you.
Anyone who works in an office with other people knows that the workplace is full of interruptions. Colleagues come by to chat, your phone rings, your desktop dings, and your focus is sabotaged time and time again.

“If we're expected to come up with novel solutions to difficult problems, we need time to sit and contemplate away from distraction,” Eyal says. He suggests that people "hack back" the external triggers that lead to distraction.

One simple way to accomplish this is to manage the notification settings on your smartphone.  For instance, try turning off personal email notifications. Unless social media is part of your job, consider turning off notifications from apps like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter during work hours. Designate a specific time(s) during your day to check personal communications—and stick to it.
