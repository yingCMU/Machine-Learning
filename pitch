We're significantly growing our team and are currently looking for strong ML engineers to work across the search stack to improve search quality from query understanding, rewriting, and the quality of our ranking models. We also have some awesome challenges we're to solve such as optimizing how search signals are used in other parts of Marketplace (e.g. the MP Feed), developing dedicated rankers for key verticals such as e-Commerce, Autos, Housing Rentals, Buy-Sell Groups etc.


This is Ying and I am exploring new teamsï¼Œspecifically I am looking for growth opportunities in ML-powered product. Your team caught my eyes with its deep root in personalization. I have always been  fascinated in understanding user perception and online behavior intents to make product more engaging. Let me know if I can have an in-person chat to learn more.




My strength 
1. Data sensitive: I have been working on perf optimization which requires deep understanding of user data to find opportunities. I am good at using logging to find problems.
2. Some ML related work in FB:
    1. worked with realtime ML team to build new multi variant tool , https://fb.workplace.com/groups/1041291836057409/permalink/1152331391620119/
    2. worked on predicting user behaviors for prefetching advertiser's data
3. Did ML model tuning back in CMU; recently in my spare time I am implementing traffic sign classification in tensor flow
4. Other works in FB
    1. (php & javascript) Developed Ads API to support product features
    2. (python) Built logging pipelines
